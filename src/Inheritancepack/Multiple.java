//Multiple -In inheritance multiple is not possible in java, because one child class can't extend two parent behaviours and methods
    //Multiple  can be achieved through INTERFACE.
/*Because due to having same mdethods in 2parent classes we will get amibiguity problems.
* If we not mentioned same methods also ,By default java will have same methods which causes amibiguity problems.
